# Fine-tuning-Llama2-for-Question-Answering-Task

## Model

For the purpose of context driven Question Answering, I chose the model- _**'meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf'**_ of Llama2 as it gives better results for the purpose.

## Dataset

The dataset used for fine-tuning the model is **'SQuAD2.0'**. 

### About the Dataset
Combines the 100,000 questions in SQuAD1.1 with over 50,000 unanswerable questions written adversarially by crowdworkers to look similar to answerable ones. To do well on SQuAD2.0, systems must not only answer questions when possible, but also determine when no answer is supported by the paragraph and abstain from answering.
